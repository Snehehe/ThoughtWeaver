## Overview

ThoughtWeaver is an AI-enhanced knowledge-mapping tool that visualizes concepts using an interactive, force-directed graph. It combines semantic reasoning, real-time physics, customizable node linking, and automated cluster detection to produce an intelligent and explorable representation of how ideas connect.

The system supports:
- AI-generated explanations for relationships
- AI-assisted cluster labeling
- Manual and automatic link creation
- Real-time graph physics with D3
- Interactive node manipulation and insight popups

## Features

### AI-Driven Capabilities
- Generates natural-language descriptions explaining relationships between concepts.
- Suggests new semantic links that users may accept or override.
- Labels clusters and cycles using AI-generated keywords.

### Graph Visualization Engine
- Force-directed physics simulation
- Collision handling and stabilization
- Dynamic edge creation and modification
- Double-click insights for nodes and relationships

### User Interaction
- Manually add, remove, or override connections
- Identify cycles and visualize cluster boundaries
- Light/dark theme compatibility
- Smooth, scalable SVG rendering
